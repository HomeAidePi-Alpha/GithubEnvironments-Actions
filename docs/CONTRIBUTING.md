# Contributing to GitHub-Environments-Actions-Projects-Alpha
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Becoming a contributor
- Infrastructure as Code
- Node, Python, NetCore, Java Development
- CI / CQ / CD - DevSecOps
- Updating this standard through committee
- Pair Programming

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Create your feature branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/HomeAidePi-Alpha/GitHubEnvironments-Actions/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and screen shots if possible
We will ideally like to create issues from Discussions as the format will be consistent and have both the breadcrumbs of conversation but may lead to issue resolution prior to issue creation. Only when approved or a period of days (denoted in the Social Contract in terms of SLA for support in days) elapses.
[Issues from Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-discussion) 

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give screen shots
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. For real! ;)
